# Introduction and Goals

The use of data from Intensive Care Units (ICUs) holds significant potential for advancing both clinical decision-making and medical research. However, the practical utilization of such data is often impeded by its inherent complexity and the heterogeneity of data sources. Effective analysis requires not only domain-specific clinical knowledge but also specialized skills in data engineering â€” a combination that is not always readily available.

The OpenICU Project addresses this challenge by providing an open-source, Python-based framework specifically designed to streamline the extraction, preprocessing, and analysis of ICU time series data. By enabling standardized and transparent data workflows, OpenICU empowers clinicians, researchers, and developers to work collaboratively and reproducibly with diverse ICU datasets. The framework is built with openness, extensibility, and ease of use in mind, making it a valuable tool in the growing field of data-driven intensive care.

## Requirements Overview



## Quality goals



## Stakeholder

The stakeholder landscape primarily comprises two closely related groups, both sharing professional backgrounds as researchers or physicians:

1. **Primary User Group**: This group focuses on leveraging the tool to extract standardized data from existing datasets, primarily for research activities. Their main interest lies in the usability, accuracy, and efficiency of data retrieval for scientific or clinical studies.
1. **Contributor Group**: In addition to using the tool for research purposes, this group actively participates in its development and enhancement. Their dual role includes providing user feedback, specifying requirements, and contributing to technical or conceptual improvements.
